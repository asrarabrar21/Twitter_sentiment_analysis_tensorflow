# Twitter_sentiment_analysis_tensorflow

This is the twitter sentiment analysis using deep learning Tensorflow framework. Also my first commit.

The model is fairly simple as it consists of only fully 3 connected layers. The model is trained of the sentiment_140 dataset available openly.

Have also performed the preprocessing required to feed the data into the neural netowrks. 

Have method to extract tweets from the twitter API stream at dev.twitter

The model predicts only two classes and can be extended further to more classes.
